This project was a graduation project from 2022-2023.

We proposed 2 approaches for the medical label recognition, a traditional method and an intelligent method.

The traditional method uses classical computer vision techniques such as Histogram, segmentation, etc. And tesseract for text detection.

The intelligent approach uses yolov8 for the medical label recognition and Google Vision API for reading the context within the label (texts and colours).

The project is now published as a Conference Paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10536801
